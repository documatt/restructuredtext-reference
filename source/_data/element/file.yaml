      Inside ``:file``, backslashes (``\``) are maybe treat differently than you expect.

      Because backslash is the escaping character. Backslash alone escape immediatelly following character, e.g. the space. To use backslash, you must escaped it too, which results in doubled backslash.

      Not escaped backslashes:
      :file:`C:\Users\matt\AppData\`

      Properly escaped:
      :file:`C:\\Users\\matt\\AppData\\`
