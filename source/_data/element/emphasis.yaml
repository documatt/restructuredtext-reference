title: emphasis

desc: |
  (Also known as *italic* or *cursive*.)

  Emphasis element is for words that have a stressed emphasis compared to surrounding text. Emphasis is typically displayed in italic.

collections:
  - inline-elements

url: https://docutils.sourceforge.io/docs/ref/rst/roles.html#emphasis

examples:
  - name: Emphasis syntax
    desc: |
      Emphasis syntax is simple: wrap the text between two ``*``.
    source: |
      Get out of bed *now*, John!

  - name: Alternative syntax
    desc: |
      Alternative to enclosing into ``*`` is to use a full role syntax: ``:emphasis:`text to emphasis```.
    source: |
      Get out of bed :emphasis:`now`, John!
  
  - name: No inline element nesting
    desc: |
      The annoying |rst| limitation is  you :ref:`can't nest inline element <no-nested-inlines>` into another, e.g. emphasis into strong emphasis, etc. Unfortunately, there is no workaround.

      Some examples of inline markup nesting that *don't work*:

      .. datatemplate:yaml:: /_data/snippet/no-nested-inlines.yaml
         :template: snippet.rst.jinja

  - name: Requires whitespace or punctation around
    desc: |
      The emphasis :ref:`requires whitespace or punctation around <inline-markup-recognition>` (as all inline-level elements). Without the delimination, |rst| will not recognize markup properly from a surrounding text.

      The following examples miss delimination at the end, the beginning, and at the both. They will cause the ``WARNING: Inline emphasis start-string without end-string``.

      .. code-block::
         :class: bad

         Don't get out of bed *before*six.

         Don't get out of bed*before* six.
         
         Don't get out of bed*before*six.
      
      Fortunately, two inline elements without no whitespace/punctation in-between are possible with *escaping mechanism* using backslash-escaped whitespace (backslash is ``\``). Backslash-espaced whitespace will be removed from the output document.

      Previous example fixed:
    source: |
      Don't get out of bed *before*\ six.

      Don't get out of bed\ *before* six.

      Don't get out of bed\ *before*\ six.
