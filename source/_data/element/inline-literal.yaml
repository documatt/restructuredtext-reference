title: inline literal

desc: |
  Inline literal element is typically used for short code examples displayed in monospace font.

collections:
  - inline-elements
  - code-examples

url: https://docutils.sourceforge.io/docs/ref/rst/roles.html#literal

examples:
  - name: Inline literal syntax
    desc: |
      Inline literal syntax is simple: wrap the text between two ``````.
    source: |
      To search on your disk, use ``find`` command.

  - name: Alternative syntax
    desc: |
      Alternative to enclosing into `````` is to use a full role syntax: ``:literal:`text```.
    source: |
      To search on your disk, use :literal:`find` command.

  - name: No inline element nesting
    desc: |
      The annoying |rst| limitation is  you :ref:`can't nest inline element <no-nested-inlines>` into another, e.g. inline literal into strong emphasis, etc. Unfortunately, there is no workaround.

      Some examples of inline markup nesting that *don't work*:

      .. datatemplate:yaml:: /_data/snippet/no-nested-inlines.yaml
         :template: snippet.rst.jinja

  - name: Requires whitespace or punctuation around
    desc: |
      The inline literal :ref:`requires whitespace or punctuation around <inline-markup-recognition>` (as all inline-level elements). Without the delimiter, |rst| will not recognize markup properly from a surrounding text.

      The following examples miss a delimiter at the end, the beginning, and at the both. They will cause the ``WARNING: Inline literal start-string without end-string``.

      .. code-block:: rst
         :linenos:
         :class: bad

         Any ``array``s will suffice.

         Any``array`` will suffice.

         Any``array``s will suffice.
      
      Fortunately, two inline elements without no whitespace/punctuation in-between are possible with *escaping mechanism* using backslash-escaped whitespace (backslash is ``\``). Backslash-escaped whitespace will be removed from the output document.

      Previous example fixed:
    source: |
      Any ``array``\ s will suffice.

      Any\ ``array`` will suffice.
        
      Any\ ``array``\ s will suffice.
