  - name: Requires whitespace or punctation around
    desc: |
      The inline literal requires whitespace or punctation around its text (as all inline-level markup). Without the delimiter, |rst| will not recognize markup from a surrounding text.

      Unfortunatelly, it is often not desired. As workaround, you have to backslash-escape whitespace before or after a role name. Backslash-espaced whitespace will be removed from the output document.
