    name: Directive name in uppercase
    desc: "Directive name is case insensitive (like all directive and role names). Most documentation and book authors prefer typing directives and roles all in lowercase. However, writing directive name in uppercase corresponds with their “raise attention” objective and improves |rst| code readibility."
    source: |
      .. DANGER:: However writing admonitions uppercase can be considered as
         reasonable exception to "all-lowercase" rule.
