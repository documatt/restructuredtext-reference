  - name: Subscript syntax
    desc: |
      Subscript syntax itself is simple: ``:sub:`text as subscript```.
    source: |
      In vino veritas, in H\ :sub:`2`\ O sanitas.

      .. note:: See bellow the meaning of awkward ``\<space>``.

  - name: No inline element nesting
    desc: |
      The annoying |rst| limitation is  you :ref:`can't nest inline element <no-nested-inlines>` into another, e.g. subscript into strong emphasis, etc. Unfortunately, there is no workaround.

      Some examples of inline markup nesting that *don't work*:

      .. datatemplate:yaml:: /_data/snippet/no-nested-inlines.yaml
         :template: snippet.rst.jinja

  - name: Requires whitespace or punctuation around
    desc: |
      The subscript :ref:`requires whitespace or punctuation around <inline-markup-recognition>` (as all inline-level elements). Without the delimiter, |rst| will not recognize markup properly from a surrounding text.

      The following examples miss a delimiter both at the and beginning and end. It will cause the ``WARNING: Inline interpreted text or phrase reference start-string without end-string.``.

      .. code-block::
         :linenos:
         :class: bad

         In vino veritas, in H:sub:`2`O sanitas.
      
      Fortunately, two inline elements without no whitespace/punctuation in-between are possible with *escaping mechanism* using backslash-escaped whitespace (backslash is ``\``). Backslash-escaped whitespace will be removed from the output document.

      Previous example fixed:

      In vino veritas, in H\ :sub:`2`\ O sanitas.
