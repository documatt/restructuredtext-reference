  - name: Requires whitespace or punctation around ``:sub:``
    desc: |
      The ``:sub:`` role requires whitespace or punctation around its text (as all roles). Without it, |rst| will not recognize a role name from the surrounding text.

      Unfortunatelly, it is often not desired with subscripts and superscripts. As workaround, you have to backslash-escape whitespace before or after a role name. Backslash-espaced whitespace will be removed from the output document.

      OK: In vino veritas, in H\ :sub:`2`\ O sanitas.
