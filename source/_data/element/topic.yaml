      topic may only occur anywhere a section or transition may occur. Nesting topic inside body element or topic, e.g.:

      .. code-block::
         :class: bad
         
         .. topic:: Topic
        
            Topic cannot be nested inside body elements or another topic.
   
            .. topic:: Another topic
      
               Another topic content.
    
      causes the following error

      ::

        WARNING: The "topic" directive may not be used within topics or body elements.

    name: Directive name in uppercase
    desc: |
      Directive name is case insensitive (like all directive and role names). Most documentation and book authors prefer typing directives and roles all in lowercase. However, writing directive name in uppercase corresponds with their “raise attention” objective and improves |rst| code readibility.

      .. code-block::
        
         .. TOPIC::
        
            Writing topic uppercase can be considered as
            reasonable exception to "all-lowercase" rule.

    name: Complex content
    desc: |
      Any |rst| elements can be in topic content. As always, you need only to keep correct indentation.

      .. code-block::

         .. topic:: Complex content
             
            This is the topic with complex body containing
   
            - two items
            - bullet list
   
            And, code example::
   
                $ nano ~/.bash_aliases
