  - tags: []
    name: Content bellow the directive

    source: |
      .. caution::
         I'm caution
  - tags: []
    name: Content bellow the directive with blank line
    desc: "Optionally, you can place a blank line before the text itself."

  - tags: []
    name: Directive name in uppercase
    desc: "Directive name is case insensitive (like all directive and role names). Most documentation and book authors prefer typing directives and roles all in lowercase. However, writing directive name in uppercase corresponds with their “raise attention” objective and improves |rst| code readibility."
    source: |
      .. CAUTION:: However writing admonitions uppercase can be considered as
         reasonable exception to "all-lowercase" rule.
