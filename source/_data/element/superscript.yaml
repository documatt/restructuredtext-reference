title: superscript

desc: |
  Superscript role displays its text as superscript (with a raised baseline using smaller text). Superscript is used in e.g., math equations.

  - inline-elements

examples:
  - name: Superscript syntax
    desc: |
      Superscript syntax itself is simple: ``:sup:`text as subscript```.
    source: |
      The E = mc\ :sup:`2` explains everything.
    more: |
      .. note:: See bellow the meaning of awkward :samp:`\\\\{space}`.
  
  - name: No inline element nesting
    desc: |
      The annoying |rst| limitation is  you :ref:`can't nest inline element <no-nested-inlines>` into another, e.g. superscript into strong emphasis, etc. Unfortunately, there is no workaround.

      Some examples of inline markup nesting that *don't work*:

      .. datatemplate:yaml:: /_data/snippet/no-nested-inlines.yaml
         :template: snippet.rst.jinja

  - name: Requires whitespace or punctation around
    desc: |
      The inline literal :ref:`requires whitespace or punctation around <inline-markup-recognition>` (as all inline-level elements). Without the delimination, |rst| will not recognize markup properly from a surrounding text.

      The following examples miss delimination at the beginning. It will even not cause any warning and prints ``The E = mc:sup:2 explains everything.``.

      .. code-block::
         :class: bad

         The E = mc:sup:`2` explains everything.
      
      Fortunately, two inline elements without no whitespace/punctation in-between are possible with *escaping mechanism* using backslash-escaped whitespace (backslash is ``\``). Backslash-espaced whitespace will be removed from the output document.

      Previous example fixed:
    source: |
      The E = mc\ :sup:`2` explains everything.
