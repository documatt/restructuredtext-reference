    desc: |
      Ability of parsed-literal to use inline markup is great for e.g.,
      terminal session examples. The following example shows emphasis, strong emphasis and external hyperlink.
    source: |
      .. parsed-literal::

         *# Prints date only*
         **$ date -I**
         2020-03-03

         Search for date in `man pages <https://manpages.ubuntu.com>`_.

  - name: Escaping inline markup
    desc: |
      If you want to prevent recognizing inline markup in parsed-literal-block, you must protect it with backslash before it.

      For example,       For example, to render find *foo* instead of find *foo* you must type ``find \*foo\*``. Compare the difference:
    source: |
      .. parsed-literal::

         # Escaped emphasis
         $ find \*foo\*

         # Not escaped emphasis
         $ find *foo*
