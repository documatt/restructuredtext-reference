  Document structure is hierarchy of its section elements. |rst| calls heading the *section* and takes different approach on section leveling than you probably expect. Section titles are decorated with the punctuation characters and importance (a section level) depends on its usage order in a document.

  .. seealso:: If you want a section-like element that doesn't make up the table of content, consider :doc:`rubric </element/rubric>`. Is not actually a section, only looks like a minor section to the readers.

      Section is text of title that is underlined, or both underlined and overlined, with same punctuation character. Decoration character is usually one (but not limited to [#section-decoration-characters]_ ) of the following::

    name: Recognizing section level
    desc: |
      Level is importance of section in the document. For example, in HTML every section level has own element like ``<h1>``, ``<h2>`` and so on. |rst| has different approach.

      What level has sections in above example? Answer is in the order of decoration styles usage in the document. Example above uses four decoration styles (underlined, or both underlined and overlined) so you have four levels:

      * section with title "Hello" is underlined and overlined with ``#`` will become level 1 (top)
      * section with title "How are you" is underlined and overlined with ``*`` will become level 2
      * section with title "It's beautiful day" is underlined with ``=`` will become level 3
      * section with title "Even it's Monday" is underlined with ``-`` will become  level 4

      If above example each decoration style is used just once. First style will  become level 1, second level 2 and so on.

      If decoration style is used once again later, it's still the same level. Have a look at more real-life example with repeated section levels.

      .. note:: Decoration style usage order to define section level has advantage you are not  limited to e.g. six nesting levels as in HTML.

      This flexibility is difficult at writing time to remember what style is what  level. Therefore almost all |rst| tech-writers adhere the following prevalence convention (we used it in above examples too).

      By this convention, first two the most important sections are both under- and overlined, the rest sections underlined only.
