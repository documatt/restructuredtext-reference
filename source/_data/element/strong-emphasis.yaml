title: strong emphasis

desc: |
  (Also known as *bold*.)

  Strong emphasis element is for words that have strong importance compared to surrounding text. Emphasis is typically displayed in bold font.

collections:
  - inline-elements

url: https://docutils.sourceforge.io/docs/ref/rst/roles.html#strong

examples:
  - name: Strong emphasis syntax
    desc: |
      Strong emphasis syntax is simple: wrap the text between two ``**``.
    source: |
      Put on **safety goggles** before proceeding.
      
  - name: Alternative syntax
    desc: |
      Alternative to enclosing into ``**`` is to use a full role syntax: ``:strong:`important text```.
    source: |
      Put on :strong:`safety goggles` before proceeding.

  - name: No inline element nesting
    desc: |
      The annoying |rst| limitation is  you :ref:`can't nest inline element <no-nested-inlines>` into another, e.g. strong emphasis into emphasis, etc. Unfortunately, there is no workaround.

      Some examples of inline markup nesting that *don't work*:

      .. datatemplate:yaml:: /_data/snippet/no-nested-inlines.yaml
         :template: snippet.rst.jinja

  - name: Requires whitespace or punctation around
    desc: |
      The strong emphasis :ref:`requires whitespace or punctation around <inline-markup-recognition>` (as all inline-level elements). Without the delimination, |rst| will not recognize markup properly from a surrounding text.

      The following examples miss delimination at the end, the beginning, and at the both. They will cause the ``WARNING: Inline strong start-string without end-string``.

      .. code-block::
         :class: bad

         Put on **safety goggles**before proceeding.

         Put on**safety goggles** before proceeding.

         Put on**safety goggles**before proceeding.
      
      Fortunately, two inline elements without no whitespace/punctation in-between are possible with *escaping mechanism* using backslash-escaped whitespace (backslash is ``\``). Backslash-espaced whitespace will be removed from the output document.

      Previous example fixed:
    source: |
      Put on **safety goggles**\ before proceeding.

      Put on\ **safety goggles** before proceeding.
         
      Put on\ **safety goggles**\ before proceeding.
