Block and inline elements
*************************

|rst| contains two types of elements: block and inline-level.

Block-level elements appear as rectangular objects that do not break across lines in the text. Examples of block elements: section title, paragraph, bullet list, and many more.

Inline elements are part of the document text flow and break across lines. Inlines are, e.g., emphasis (italic), strong emphasis (bold), inline literal (code example in the monospace font), and a few more.

It is very intuitive to differentiate between inline and block elements.
