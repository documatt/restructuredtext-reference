Block and inline elements
*************************

|rst| contains two types of elements: block and inline-level.

Block-level elements appear in the text as the rectangular objects which do no break across lines. Examples of block elements: section title, paragraph, bullet list, and many more.

Inline elements are part of the document text flow and they do break across lines. Inlines are e.g. emphasis (italic), strong emphasis (bold), inline literal (code example in monospace font) and few more.

It is very intuitive to differentiate between inline and block elements.
