About
*****

|project| is a showcase of `Sphinx <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/>`_ documentation projects possibilities. It demonstrates almost all standard reStructuredText syntax with Sphinx additions.

|project| is useful if you are creating a `custom Sphinx HTML theme <https://documatt.com/blog/sphinx-theming/index.html>`_ and want to be sure your theme style doesn't forgot to style some part of Sphinx generated HTML.

.. tip:: You can read about my other Sphinx documentation tools and tech writing tips, tricks, and insights at `Tech writer at work <https://documatt.com/blog/>`_ blog.
