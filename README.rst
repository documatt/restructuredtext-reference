|project| is a showcase of `Sphinx <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/>`_ documentation project possibilities. It demonstrates almost all standard reStructuredText syntax with Sphinx additions.

.. rubric:: Homepage is https://gitlab.com/documatt/sphinx-demo-project, where issues and contributions are welcome too!

|project| is useful if you are creating a `custom Sphinx HTML theme <https://techwriter.documatt.com/sphinx-theming/index.html>`_ and want to be sure your theme style doesn't forgot to style some part of Sphinx generated HTML.

It is based and inspired by original `Docutils demo.txt <https://repo.or.cz/docutils.git/blob_plain/HEAD:/docutils/docs/user/rst/demo.txt>`_ with Sphinx specific syntax and much better organization.

See this Sphinx project `in action <https://documatt.gitlab.io/sphinx-themes/demos/sphinx_documatt_theme>`_ with e.g. `Sphinx Documatt Theme <https://documatt.gitlab.io/sphinx-themes/sphinx-documatt-theme.html>`_.

.. tip:: Checkout also my `Sphinx Themes Collection <https://documatt.gitlab.io/sphinx-themes/>`_ suitable both for documentation and prose.
